# TTS Announce


Automations often can be triggered unexpectedly. If an automation creates sound announcement (either just by playing a sound effect, or by  text-to-speech), it can be a problem if another automation is also triggered while the first one is still playing its sound, because the second sound will stop the first.


Have this in appdeamon's config:

```
python_packages:
  - mutagen
```


## Example appdaemon/apps/apps.yaml
```
tts_announce:
  class: tts_announce
  module: tts_announce
  speech_token: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  ha_url: http://192.168.x.xxx:8123
  tts_platform: google_cloud
  tts_language: hu-HU
  speaker: media_player.mpd
  night_volume: 0.6
  day_volume: 0.8
  debug: True
  extra_delay_if_sleeps: False
```  

Where 

**speech_token**

is a long lived token created in Home Assistant. 
It also can be placed in secrets.yaml and then have
  speech_token: !secret speech_token
in apps.yaml, just don't forget to restart Appdaemon after it, as it caches secrets.yaml

**ha_url** 

is how you access Home Assistant on the local network. 
It is used to access the TTS API, and also as url for the files to be played


**tts_platform**

The same platform you specify in Home Assistant configuration.yaml under tts

**tts_language**

Default language for TTS. Can specify a different for any event call

**speaker**

Id of the media_player entity to play sounds on

**night_volume**

Volume level between 0 and 1 for the night (22-05)
When set to 0 or left out from apps.yaml, no volume change will take place

**day_volume**

Volume level between 0 and 1 for the day (05-22)
When set to 0 or left out from apps.yaml, no volume change will take place

**debug**

Log every detail of processing in Appdaemon's log when set to True

**extra_delay_if_sleeps**

Can be set to True for Google devices to have an extra 3 secs delay when the speaker is
in "off" state, because it takes about 2 secs to wake it up


Optionally **media_path:** can also be specified for the sound effect files. 
When it is missing from apps.yaml, its default value is /local/media/


## Using it from automations

TTS message started with a bell:

```
  action:
    - event: tts_announce
      event_data:
        filename: bells/proxima.ogg
        message: "Someone is at the door"
```

Where it could be used with either only "message:" specified, when no effect is required, or only with "filename:" parameter when no TTS is wanted.


Optionally the delay can also be specified for example when it is a long mp3
and only the first 5 seconds requied:
```
  action:
    - event: tts_announce
      event_data:
        filename: effects/very_long.mp3
        delay: 5
        message: "And this is the announcement"
```

Language speech parameter can also be specified instead of the default one.
```
  action:
    - event: tts_announce
      event_data:
        message: "Guten morgen schÃ¶nheit!"
        language: de-DE
```

Randomized effect and message with template
  action:
```  
  - event: tts_announce
    event_data_template:
        filename: >
            {% if (range(1,100) | random | int) > 50 %}
            pumukli/jol_aludtal_kakaot.mp3
            {% else %}
            pumukli/jo_reggelt_kivanok.mp3
            {% endif %}        
        message: >-
            {{ [
            "First funny message",
            "Second",
            "Third"
            ] |random }}
```
